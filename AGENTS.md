# RetailGrowthAI - AI Development Instructions

Before starting any development task, read:

1. docs/PROJECT_STATE.md
2. docs/NEXT_TASK.md
3. docs/DECISIONS.md
4. docs/WORK_LOG.md

Rules:
- Continue existing work; do not restart completed tasks.
- Reuse suitable WineShopPOS components.
- Never modify WineShopPOS production resources.
- Keep RetailGrowthAI DEV and PROD isolated.
- Use Git Bash in VS Code.
- Use npm for JavaScript and uv for Python.
- Prefer low-cost Azure and Supabase architecture.
- Do not implement Postiz or Razorpay.
- Implement platform integrations in Part 2.
- Implement Wan video integration in Part 3.
- Test security and tenant isolation throughout.

After each completed development task:
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md.
- Update NEXT_TASK.md.
- Append a summary to WORK_LOG.md.
- Document any new architecture decision.
- Run appropriate tests.
- Commit and push using scripts/checkpoint.sh.
- Record blockers and unverified work honestly.
